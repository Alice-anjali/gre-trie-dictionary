## Notes

Bugfixes are generally welcome. If you want to contribute something which changes major parts of the app, please talk to someone with commit privileges first. Nothing is more frustrating than putting a lot of work and effort into a new feature and then having the PR rejected because it doesnâ€™t fit design-wise.

If you submit a PR you must accept the Contributor License Agreement. There is no way around that, since otherwise changing the license later - even to something more permissive! - , becomes close to impossible.
